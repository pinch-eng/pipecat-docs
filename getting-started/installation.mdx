## Prerequisites

Pipecat requires Python 3.10 or higher. To check your Python version:

```bash
python --version
```

## Accounts you'll need

While you can use Pipecat without third-party services, integrating with the following providers will enhance your bot's capabilities. Here's what we recommend for getting started:

### Essential services for the quickstart

## Setting up your project

### Create a virtual environment

We recommend using a virtual environment to manage your dependencies:

```bash
mkdir pipecat-project
cd pipecat-project
python3 -m venv env
```

Activate the virtual environment based on your operating system:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="macOS/Linux">
  
  ```bash
  source env/bin/activate
  ```
  
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Windows">

    ```bash
    source env/Scripts/activate # If using Git Bash
    # OR
    .\env\Scripts\activate # If using Command Prompt
    # OR
    .\env\Scripts\Activate.ps1 # If using PowerShell
    ```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Install Pipecat

The `pipecat-ai` Python module uses optional dependencies to keep your installation lightweight. This approach lets you include only the specific AI libraries you need for your project.

To install Pipecat with support for the recommended services above, use this command:

```bash
pip install "pipecat-ai[webrtc,deepgram,openai,cartesia]"
```

<Tip>
  You can add this to your `requirements.txt` file or include any combination of
  [supported integrations](/server/services/supported-services) based on your
  needs.
</Tip>

## Configure your services

### Cartesia Text-to-Speech Setup

1. Visit [Cartesia's Voice library](https://play.cartesia.ai/voices)
2. Find a voice you like and click the three dots at the end of the row
3. Select `Copy ID` to get your voice ID
4. Go to [Cartesia API keys](https://play.cartesia.ai/keys) and create an API key

## Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file in your project directory with your service credentials:

```env
CARTESIA_API_KEY=your_cartesia_api_key
CARTESIA_VOICE_ID=your_voice_id
```

<Note>
  Make sure to add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file to avoid accidentally
  committing sensitive API keys.
</Note>
