### Development

The documentation is using [Mintlify](https://mintlify.com/) to render beautifuly. Mintlify comes with a set of [components](https://mintlify.com/docs/content/components/) to help you write better more interactive documentation.

Install the [Mint CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mint) to preview the documentation changes locally. To install, use the following command

```
npm i -g mint
```

Run the following command at the root of your documentation (where mint.json is)

```
mint dev
```

Open `https://localhost:3000` in your browser and check your changes.

#### Troubleshooting

- Mintlify dev isn't running - Run `mint update` to get the latest version.
- Page loads as a 404 - Make sure you are running in a folder with `mint.json`
