---

## Prerequisites

### System requirements

- Python 3.10+
- Linux, MacOS, or Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com) installed on your system
- Access to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub, GitHub Container Registry, etc.)

### Install Docker

Docker Desktop is recommended for development environments as it provides a comprehensive GUI and tools.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="macOS">
    Download and follow the [official installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install).

    <Info>
      Using Homebrew (`brew install docker`) only installs the Docker CLI, not the Docker Engine needed to build and run containers.
    </Info>

  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Windows">
    1. For Windows 10/11 Pro, Enterprise, or Education:
       - Download [Docker Desktop for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/)
    
    2. For Windows Home or older versions:
       - First install [WSL 2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)
       - Then install [Docker Desktop for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/)
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Linux">
    Docker provides official installation guides for various Linux distributions:
    
    - [Ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/)
    - [Debian](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/debian/)
    - [RHEL](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/rhel/)
    - [Fedora](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/fedora/)
    - [CentOS](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/centos/)
    - [SLES](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/sles/)
    
    After installation, you may want to [configure Docker to run without sudo](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/#manage-docker-as-a-non-root-user).
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Set up a container registry

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Docker Hub account">
    If you don't already have a Docker Hub account, [create one for free](https://hub.docker.com/signup).
    
  <Note>
    While other container registries will work, this guide uses Docker Hub in its examples.
  </Note>

  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Log in to Docker">

    After creating your account, log in via your terminal:

    ```bash
    docker login
    ```

    <Note>
      Learn about different Docker login options in the [official documentation](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/login/).
    </Note>

  </Step>
  
  <Step title="No repository creation needed yet">
    Unlike some services, with Docker Hub you don't need to create a repository in advance.
    
    When you push your first image later in this guide, a repository will be automatically created with the name you specify.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Take note of your Docker Hub username - you'll need it when pushing your agent
  image in later steps.
</Tip>

### Create service accounts

The Pipecat Cloud starter agent uses OpenAI for LLM inference and Cartesia for text-to-speech. You will need API keys for both services.

- [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/api-keys)
- [Cartesia API key](https://play.cartesia.ai/keys)

## Create your starter project

A bare-bones voice AI agent template is available to help you get started. You'll need to set up your Python environment and authenticate with Pipecat Cloud before initializing the starter project.

First, create a new directory for your project:

```bash
mkdir pipecat-cloud-starter && cd pipecat-cloud-starter
```

### Configure your Python environment

We recommend using a virtual environment to isolate your project dependencies:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Using uv (recommended)">
    [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) is a fast, modern Python package installer and environment manager.

    ```bash
    # Install uv
    pip install uv

    # Create a virtual environment
    uv venv

    # Activate the environment
    source .venv/bin/activate  # On Unix/macOS
    .venv\Scripts\activate     # On Windows
    ```

Can't `pip install uv`? Follow the [uv installation instructions](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) instead.

  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Using venv (standard)">
    Python's built-in `venv` module:

    ```bash
    # Create a virtual environment
    python -m venv .venv

    # Activate the environment
    source .venv/bin/activate  # On Unix/macOS
    .venv\Scripts\activate     # On Windows
    ```

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Set up Pipecat Cloud

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Pipecat Cloud account">
    Create an account at [pipecat.daily.co](https://pipecat.daily.co).
    <Note>
      You must have valid billing information associated with your account in
      order to deploy agents.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Install Pipecat Cloud CLI">
  
    With your environment activated, install the Pipecat Cloud CLI:
    ```bash
    pip install pipecatcloud
    ```

    <Note>
      The Pipecat Cloud CLI can be used with either `pipecatcloud` or `pcc` as the command prefix.
    </Note>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Authenticate">
    Run `pcc auth login` to authenticate via your browser (if this doesn't
    work, try `python -m pipecatcloud auth login`.)
  </Step>
</Steps>

If you are working as part of a team, you can also create an organization and invite other Pipecat Cloud accounts to collaborate. See [Accounts and Organizations](./fundamentals/accounts-and-organizations) for more information.

### Initialize the starter project

Now, use the Pipecat Cloud CLI to download the starter template:

```bash
pcc init
```

This command downloads a template that includes everything you need to build and deploy your first voice AI agent.

<Info>
  The starter template comes from the [pipecat-cloud-starter GitHub
  repository](https://github.com/daily-co/pipecat-cloud-starter).
</Info>

**Project structure**

The starter project includes these key files:

- `bot.py`: Python entry-point containing your Pipecat agent pipeline
- `Dockerfile`: Dockerfile for building the agent container
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies used by your agent code
- `pcc-deploy.toml`: Pipecat Cloud deployment configuration file (optional)

## Deploy the agent

Pipecat Cloud expects a built Docker image that includes the agent code and all
dependencies.

<Note>
  Most agent images will extend from one of the Pipecat Cloud base images. These
  images include key dependencies and configurations that ensure your agent will
  run correctly, efficiently and securely. You can browse the base images on
  [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/dailyco/).
</Note>

For more information about how to containerize your agent code, see [Agent Images](./fundamentals/agent-images).

### Build and push your Docker image

**Build your Docker image**

From within your project directory, run Docker build:

```shell
docker build --platform=linux/arm64 -t my-first-agent:latest .
```

This command builds a Docker image named `my-first-agent` with the tag `latest` from the current directory.

<Note>
  The `--platform=linux/arm64` flag is required as Pipecat Cloud runs on ARM64
  architecture.
</Note>

**Tag your Docker image**

Using the Docker image you just built, tag it with your Docker Hub username and a version number. The tag should be `[your-username]/[image-name]:[version-number]`.

```shell
docker tag my-first-agent:latest your-username/my-first-agent:0.1
```

**Push your Docker image**

After tagging your image, you can push it to your Docker Hub registry:

```shell
docker push your-username/my-first-agent:0.1
```

<Note>
  While in beta, Pipecat Cloud requires that your agent image is pushed to your
  own repository, such as Docker Hub. Both public and private repositories are
  supported.
</Note>

### Add secrets

[Secrets](./fundamentals/secrets) are a secure way to manage sensitive information such as API keys, passwords, and other credentials.

The starter project requires the following API keys:

- [OpenAI <Icon icon="arrow-up-right-from-square" iconType="solid" />](https://www.openai.com) API key
- [Cartesia <Icon icon="arrow-up-right-from-square" iconType="solid" />](https://play.cartesia.ai) API key
- Daily API key (automatically provided through your Pipecat Cloud account)

Pipecat Cloud organizes your secrets into secret sets. This allows you to re-use the same set of secrets across multiple agents within your organization.

**Creating a secret set from a file (recommended)**

The starter project includes an `env.example` file that you can use as a template. Create a copy of this file and add your actual API keys:

```bash
# Copy the example file
cp env.example .env

# Edit the file with your API keys
# CARTESIA_API_KEY=your_cartesia_key
# OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
```

Then, create a secret set from this file:

```bash
pcc secrets set my-first-agent-secrets --file .env
```

<Accordion title="Alternative: Creating secrets directly via CLI">
If you prefer, you can also create secrets directly via the command line:

```shell
pcc secrets set my-first-agent-secrets \
  CARTESIA_API_KEY=your_cartesia_key \
  OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
```

</Accordion>

<Tip>
  For more information on managing secrets, see
  [Secrets](./fundamentals/secrets).
</Tip>

### Create a deployment

The CLI `deploy` command requires three key pieces of information:

1. The name of your agent on Pipecat Cloud
2. The repository and tag of your Docker image
3. The secrets set to use for environment variables

Let's deploy the agent using your pushed image:

```shell
pcc deploy my-first-agent your-username/my-first-agent:0.1 --secrets my-first-agent-secrets
```

When you run this command, you'll be asked to confirm your deployment configuration before proceeding.

<Tip>
  The starter project includes a `pcc-deploy.toml` file that already has the
  agent name, image reference, and secret set configured. If you're using this
  file, you can simply run `pcc deploy` without additional arguments.

See the [Deployments](./fundamentals/deploy#using-pcc-deploy-toml) section to learn more.

</Tip>

<Accordion title="Using credentials for private repositories">
If your repository is private you can provide the deploy command access credentials by specifying image pull secrets via the `--credentials` flag:

```shell
# Create an image pull secret (you'll be prompted for credentials)
pcc secrets image-pull-secret pull-secret https://index.docker.io/v1/

# Then use it in your deployment
pcc deploy my-first-agent your-username/my-first-agent:0.1 --credentials pull-secret
```

Learn more about [Image Pull Secrets](./fundamentals/secrets#image-pull-secrets) including how to create them for Docker Hub.

</Accordion>

For more deployment configuration options, see the [deploy reference docs](./cli-reference/deploy).

### Check the status of your deployment

Assuming the deployment was successful, you can check the status of your agent using the CLI:

```shell
# Deployment status
pcc agent status my-first-agent

# List deployment history
pcc agent deployments my-first-agent
```

## Scale the deployment

Right now, your deployment has been made with the default runtime configuration.

This means that your agent defaults to "scale-to-zero", with no minimum agent instances to serve on-demand session requests.

If you were to attempt to connect with your agent now, it's likely you'd encounter a cold start while the agent spins up. Cold starts typically take around 10 seconds.

To avoid this, you can scale your deployment to a minimum of one instance:

```shell
pcc deploy my-first-agent your-username/my-first-agent:0.1 --min-agents 1
```

This will provide you with one warm instance ready to serve any active sessions.

<Info>
  By default, idle agent instances are maintained for 5 minutes before being
  terminated when using scale-to-zero. For more information, see
  [Scaling](./fundamentals/scaling).
</Info>

<Warning>
  Setting `--min-agents` to 1 or greater will incur charges even when the agent
  is not in use.
</Warning>

## Start an active session

Now that your agent has been deployed, you can start an active session to interact with it.

Creating active sessions requires passing a valid API key for your namespace or organization. This is used to authenticate the request and prevent unauthorized access.

### Create a public access key

```shell
pcc organizations keys create
```

Running this command will ask if you'd like to set this key as your default.
Doing so will associate the created key with your current namespace, allowing you to omit the `--api-key` flag in future requests.

Next set the key to be used with your agent:

```shell
pcc organizations keys use
```

When prompted, select your agent from the list.

### Talk to your agent

The starter project is configured to use [Daily](https://www.daily.co) as a WebRTC transport.
Pipecat Cloud has a direct integration with Daily, meaning you are issued a Daily API key when you create an account.

```shell
pcc agent start my-first-agent --use-daily
```

This command will start a new active session with your agent. Since you are using Daily, you will be given a URL in the terminal to open in your browser. This will open a new tab where you can interact with your agent.

<Note>
When using the Daily key associated with your Pipecat Cloud account, your Daily voice minutes for one human and one bot are free.

Additional charges apply for features like recording, transcription, and PSTN/SIP. See [Daily’s pricing page](https://www.daily.co/pricing/pipecat-cloud/) for more information.

</Note>

<Accordion title="Alternative ways to start a session">
In addition to the CLI approach shown above, you can start sessions programmatically:

#### Use the REST API

```bash
curl --location --request POST 'https://api.pipecat.daily.co/v1/public/my-first-agent/start' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_PUBLIC_API_KEY' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data-raw '{
    "createDailyRoom": true,
    "body": {"custom": "data"}
  }'
```

#### Use the Python SDK

```python
import asyncio

from pipecatcloud.exception import AgentStartError
from pipecatcloud.session import Session, SessionParams


async def main():
    try:
        # Create session object
        session = Session(
            agent_name="my-first-agent",
            api_key=API_KEY,  # Replace with your actual API key
            params=SessionParams(
                use_daily=True,  # Optional: Creates a Daily room
                daily_room_properties={"start_video_off": False},
                data={"key": "value"},
            ),
        )

        # Start the session
        response = await session.start()

        # Get Daily room URL
        daily_url = f"{response['dailyRoom']}?t={response['dailyToken']}"
        print(f"Join Daily room: {daily_url}")

except AgentStartError as e:
        print(f"Error starting agent: {e}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Unexpected error: {e}")


# Run the async function
if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

These approaches are particularly useful when integrating agent sessions into your own applications, such as web interfaces or backend services.

</Accordion>

For more information on starting sessions, see [Active Sessions](./fundamentals/active-sessions).

## Monitor and Troubleshoot

Once your agent is deployed, you can use the following commands to monitor its status and troubleshoot any issues:

```shell
# Check deployment status
pcc agent status my-first-agent

# View deployment logs
pcc agent logs my-first-agent
```

These commands provide visibility into your agent's operation and can help diagnose problems if your agent isn't functioning as expected.

## Next Steps

Congratulations! You have successfully deployed your first agent to Pipecat Cloud.

As a next step, we recommend exploring how you can make your deployment production ready.

See [Scaling](./fundamentals/scaling) for more information on scaling your deployment.
